# Lab6: Interactive Map
## Introduction

This tutorial uses a Python library called Folium and pandas to create several interactive maps. The first two maps are:
* A choropleth map which shades in LA County zip codes based on how many Starbucks are contained in each one (and you'll learn why this is a terrible idea!)
* A precise map of all Starbucks' locations in LA County

The third map is the map the unemployment rate by state by 2012.

## Result
The first map shows the number of Starbucks in each zip code.
